# API Gateway Fixes and Improvements

This document summarizes the changes made to fix and improve the API Gateway for the Car Rental system.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Handler Structure Reorganization**: Completely reorganized handler files for better maintainability.
   - Separated handlers by service domain (car.go, booking.go, user.go, statistics.go)
   - Simplified the base handler.go file
   - Fixed duplicate handler implementations
   - Made all handlers consistent with Gin framework

2. **Import Path Issues**: Fixed import paths for proto files to ensure proper communication with microservices.

3. **Authentication Middleware**: Improved the authentication middleware to better handle JWT tokens.
   - Added structured Claims type
   - Improved token validation process
   - Added admin-only middleware
   - Enhanced security with better error messages

4. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling middleware to catch panics and return proper error responses.

5. **Configuration Management**: Added enhanced configuration management with environment variables.
   - Created a structured configuration system with defaults
   - Added support for `.env` file loading
   - Improved service connection handling

6. **Telemetry and Metrics**: Enhanced the metrics collection system to provide more detailed information.
   - Added request duration tracking
   - Improved error counting
   - Added service status reporting

7. **CORS Configuration**: Updated CORS middleware to support configurable origins and improved security.

## New Features Added

1. **Complete Statistics API**: Added comprehensive statistics endpoints:
   - `/statistics/bookings`: Get booking statistics
   - `/statistics/cars`: Get car statistics
   - `/statistics/revenue`: Get revenue statistics
   - `/statistics/popular-locations`: Get popular locations
   - `/statistics/users`: Get user statistics
   - All endpoints support time range filtering (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)

2. **Helper Scripts**:
   - `install_deps.ps1`: Script to install required dependencies
   - `start.ps1`: Script to easily start the API Gateway
   - `test_api.ps1`: Comprehensive script to test all API Gateway endpoints

3. **Documentation**:
   - Added detailed README.md with setup instructions and API documentation
   - Added inline code comments for better maintainability
   - Updated CHANGES.md with detailed descriptions of all modifications

4. **Improved Route Handling**:
   - Added missing route handlers
   - Standardized request and response formats
   - Added proper validation for all endpoints

## Testing and Verification

To verify the API Gateway is working correctly:

1. Start the required microservices:
   - User Service
   - Inventory Service
   - Booking Service
   - Statistics Service

2. Start the API Gateway:
   ```
   .\start.ps1
   ```

3. Run the test script to verify endpoints:
   ```
   .\test_api.ps1
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. Implement proper JWT token validation using the configured secret
2. Add request rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
4. Add detailed logging for better debugging
5. Implement circuit breakers for better resilience when microservices are unavailable
6. Add health check endpoints for each microservice
7. Implement API versioning for better backward compatibility
